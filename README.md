# Snake Game

A classic Snake Game implemented using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. This project includes features like speed control, scoring system, wall collision detection, and a game-over condition when the snake hits the wall or itself.

## Features

- **Start Game**: Begins the game with the default speed.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's score as the snake consumes food.
- **Wall Collision**: The game ends if the snake hits the wall.
- **Self-Collision**: The game ends if the snake runs into itself.
- **Partial Food Contact Scoring**: Score increases even if the snake's body only partially touches the food.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Click on the "Start Game" button to begin.
2. **Control the Snake**: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the snake in the desired direction:
   - `Up Arrow` to move up
   - `Down Arrow` to move down
   - `Left Arrow` to move left
   - `Right Arrow` to move right
3. **Increase or Decrease Speed**: Use the "Increase Speed" and "Decrease Speed" buttons to adjust the snake's speed.
4. **Reset the Game**: Click the "Reset Game" button to start over.
